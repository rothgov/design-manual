    <p class="f3">We communicate our values through our brand:</p>
    <ul class="measure-wide">
      <li class="mb2">Honest - Open and truthful in everything we say and do</li>
      <li class="mb2">Accountable - We own our decisions, we do what we say and we acknowledge and learn from our mistakes</li>
      <li class="mb2">Respectful - We show regard and sensitivity for the feelings, rights and views of others</li>
      <li class="mb2">Ambitious - We are dedicated, committed and positive, embracing change with energy and creativity</li>
      <li class="mb2">Proud - We take pride in our borough and in the job that we do</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="measure-wide">A brand is more than just a logo &mdash; it is about an organisation's values and beliefs and how it wishes to be thought of and perceived. Our brand reflects our core values and gives us a common base for clear, consistent, unified, credible and effective communication.</p>
    <p class="measure-wide">We need a strong brand to help our staff communicate in a more coherent and consistent way. Staff need to be reassured and understand that there is a reason for change and that it is part of an overall drive towards delivering better and more efficient servivces.</p>
