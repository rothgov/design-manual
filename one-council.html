    <p class="f3 measure-wide">The language we use, both written and spoken, is important. It is a key element of any brand and affects how people see, think and respond to us.</p>
    <p class="measure-wide">We are all about people, so people should understand us. There should be a person behind the words. The person should be the ambassador for our brand â€“ caring, clear, respectful, considerate and appropriate.</p>
    <p class="measure-wide">Appropriate means we should adapt our language for each particular audience and that audience should be able to understand us.</p>
